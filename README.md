## Installation ##
Run `./installer.sh` after cloning the repository. 

You'll probably need to install the included font (nerdfont for icons) in the `Editor/` directory. 
Everything in that directory must be manually installed. 

Also, don't worry about the Rust toolchain install. 
The toolchain installation is very simple and there's no real `conda`/`venv`/`nvm`/`rbenv` 
equivalent for managing Rust versions since the language comes with one 
(which you don't have to install if you choose customize installation but I recommend it).
